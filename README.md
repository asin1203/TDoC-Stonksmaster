## **About the project:** 
This is a stock prediction project based on Deep Learning. It makes use of supervised Machine Learning to predict the future Stock Prices with Past prices as input. We make use of available free data of stock prices to train our supervised Model. 

## **Deep Learning Algorithms**
Long short-term memory (LSTM) : an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning.

## **Tech stacks used:**
Python 3, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn,keras

## **Aim:**
To predict the stock prices of future datetime based on previous data with utmost accuracy and minimum complexity.
